## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed globally. You can install it with bun:
    ```bash
    bun install -g wrangler
    ```
-   A Cloudflare account.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codepod.git
    cd codepod
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as the package manager.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Log in to Wrangler:**
    Authenticate the Wrangler CLI with your Cloudflare account.
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

To start the development server for both the frontend and the backend worker, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server for the React application and the Wrangler development server for the Hono API, with live reloading enabled. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment).

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application source code.
    -   `components/`: Shared UI components, including shadcn/ui components.
    -   `pages/`: Route components for different views of the application.
    -   `lib/`: Utilities, type definitions, and API client functions.
    -   `main.tsx`: The entry point for the React application, including routing setup.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Cloudflare Worker source code.
    -   `index.ts`: The entry point for the Hono API server.
    -   `userRoutes.ts`: Example route definitions.
    -   `durableObject.ts`: The implementation of the Cloudflare Durable Object.
-   `wrangler.jsonc`: Configuration file for the Cloudflare Worker.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for the Vite build tool.

## Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Build the project:**
    First, build the frontend application and the worker.
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy with Wrangler:**
    The `deploy` script in `package.json` handles both the build and deployment process.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

    Wrangler will bundle your application and deploy it to your Cloudflare account. You will be provided with a public URL for your deployed application.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your Git repository using the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
